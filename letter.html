        Hi Sem! I never knew my years could be as beautiful as the ones I had only imagined before you. You brought vibrance, yellow, and gold to my days. Everything I could have wished for, that I didn’t even know was possible, happened in such a short amount of time. My heart races and fills with so much love every time I see you that it might burst at any moment – it’s overwhelming, yet such a wonderful feeling. Thank you for experiencing my messy moments and still staying. You are, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful gifts I’ve ever been blessed with, and one of the gifts I look forward to seeing every holiday in this lifetime. HAPPY NEW YEAR, SEMMM!!!! I LOVE YOU!!!.
